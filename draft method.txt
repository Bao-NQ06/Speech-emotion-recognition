===============================================================================
ABSTRACT
===============================================================================

This paper presents an enhanced deep learning approach for audio emotion recognition that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the EmoDB dataset. Our methodology combines advanced preprocessing techniques, comprehensive data augmentation strategies, attention mechanisms, and balanced training methodologies to achieve 95.1% accuracy and 95.1% F1-score across seven emotion classes. The proposed system addresses key challenges including class imbalance, limited training data, and feature representation through a novel combination of MFCC-based feature extraction, multi-type data augmentation, and an attention-enhanced convolutional neural network architecture.

1. INTRODUCTION
===============================================================================

Audio emotion recognition (AER) enables machines to understand human emotional states through voice analysis. Despite advances in deep learning, AER remains challenging due to subjective emotion nature, speaker variability, and limited annotated datasets.

This paper addresses limitations through comprehensive enhancement:
- Advanced MFCC-based feature extraction with delta features
- Multi-modal data augmentation (pitch, noise, time stretching)
- Attention-enhanced CNN architecture
- Balanced training using computed class weights

Contributions:
1. Comprehensive audio preprocessing pipeline for emotion recognition
2. Novel attention mechanism integration in CNN architectures
3. Advanced audio-specific data augmentation strategies
4. Balanced training methodology addressing class imbalance
5. State-of-the-art performance: 95.1% accuracy on EmoDB dataset

2. METHODOLOGY
===============================================================================

2.1 Dataset and Emotion Mapping
================================

EmoDB dataset: 535 audio files, 10 German speakers, 7 emotions
Emotion mapping:
- Fear (F) â†’ 0, Disgust (E) â†’ 1, Happy (W) â†’ 2, Angry (A) â†’ 3
- Sad (T) â†’ 4, Neutral (N) â†’ 5, Boredom (L) â†’ 6

2.2 Enhanced Preprocessing Pipeline
===================================

Audio Loading:
- Standardized resampling to 44,100 Hz
- Stereo to mono conversion for consistency

Windowing Strategy:
- Half-overlapping windows (50% overlap)
- Creates multiple segments per audio file
- Significantly increases training data

Feature Extraction:
- 128 MFCC coefficients per frame
- 128 frames per window (hop_length=512, n_fft=1024)
- 3-channel features: MFCC + Delta + Delta-Delta
- Consistent 128Ã—128Ã—3 feature maps

2.3 Advanced Data Augmentation
==============================

Four augmentation strategies applied to each audio segment:

1. Pitch Shifting: Â±2 semitones range
2. Noise Addition: Gaussian noise (0.001 Ã— signal_std)
3. Time Stretching: 0.8Ã— to 1.2Ã— speed variation
4. Original Signal: Unmodified baseline

Effectively quadruples dataset size while preserving emotional content.
